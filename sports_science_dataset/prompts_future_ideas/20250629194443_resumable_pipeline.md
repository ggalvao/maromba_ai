# Future Improvement: Implement a Resumable Data Collection Pipeline

**Objective:** Modify the `sports_science_dataset` pipeline to support resumability, preventing the loss of progress and reducing redundant API calls if the script is interrupted.

### Key Implementation Ideas:

1.  **Implement Step-by-Step Checkpointing:**
    -   After each major, resource-intensive stage (e.g., API data collection, AI filtering, PDF processing), save the intermediate results for the current domain to a temporary file (e.g., `data/tmp/checkpoint_domain_step.json`).
    -   When the script starts, it should check for these checkpoint files. If a valid checkpoint exists for a given step, it should load the data from the file instead of re-executing the step.

2.  **Enhance PDF Download Resumability:**
    -   Modify the `PDFProcessor` to check for the existence of a PDF file (using its unique ID) in the `data/raw_papers` directory before attempting to download it again.

3.  **Refine Database Interaction:**
    -   While the current database deduplication is a good safeguard, the pipeline should avoid re-processing data that has already been successfully stored. The checkpointing system will be the primary mechanism for this.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- If the pipeline is stopped midway through processing a domain, restarting it should resume from the last successfully completed step.
- The system should not re-download existing PDF files.
- The system should not make redundant API calls for data that has already been fetched and checkpointed.
